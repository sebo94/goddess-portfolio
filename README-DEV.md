## Optimizations

1. Change libraries to smaller ones based on needs (parallax (pure css/js), infinite carousel, aos(alternative: scroll out), Isotope(can use pure css))
2. Image optimizations (quality, sizes, metatags, cdns)
3. Lazy loading optimization / webpack bundling (fixnavbar issues)
4. Refactor code/data files
5. Rework layout component structure (or remove it entirely)
6. Show only one spinner at the time

2. Find a way to track who's sharing the projects
3. Add routing for projects and services
4. Cross platform compatibility
